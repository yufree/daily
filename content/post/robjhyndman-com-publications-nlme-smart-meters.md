description: Buildings are typically equipped with smart meters to measure electricity
  demand at regular intervals. Smart meter data for a single building have many uses,
  such as forecasting and assessing overall building performance. However, when data
  are available from multiple buildings, there are additional applications that are
  rarely explored. For instance, we can explore how different building characteristics
  influence energy demand. If each building is treated as a random effect and building
  characteristics are handled as fixed effects, a mixed effects model can be used
  to estimate how ...
