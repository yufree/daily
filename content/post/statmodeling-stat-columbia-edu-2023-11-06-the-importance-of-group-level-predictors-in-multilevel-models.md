description: Political scientist and Stan user Josh Alley points to this new paper
  on using hierarchical (multilevel) models to estimate heterogeneous effects. I like
  it. The only thing I&#8217;d add is an emphasis that group-level predictors can
  be important. Jennifer and &#8230; <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/11/06/the-importance-of-group-level-predictors-in-multilevel-models/">Continue
