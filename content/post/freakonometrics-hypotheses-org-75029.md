description: In a couple of days, I will be in Warsow for a Summer School, to give
  a short course on Insurance, biases, discrimination and fairness, invited by Łukasz
  Delong. Slides are now available. This course will provide a state-of-the-art, on
  fairness and discrimination, in the context of insurance pricing (and more generally,
  predictive models). As explained by Avraham et al. (2014) &#8220;insurance companies
  are in the business of discrimination. Insurers attempt to segregate insureds into
  separate risk pools based on the differences in their risk &#8230; <a href="https://freakonometrics.hypotheses
