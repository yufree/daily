description: Our paper, written with Cassandra Mussard, intern last summer, and Stéphane
  Mussard, entitled KNN and K-means in Gini Prametric Spaces will be presented this
  Fall at the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence, ECAI 2025, that
  will take place on October 25-30, 2025, in Bologna, Italy. This paper introduces
  innovative enhancements to the K-means and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms
  based on the concept of Gini prametric spaces. Unlike traditional distance metrics,
  Gini-based measures incorporate both value-based and rank-based information, improving
  robustness to noise and ...
