  In late June, I will be in New York to teach my 3-day workshop on Forecasting using R. Tickets are available at Eventbrite.
  This is the first time I&rsquo;ve taught this workshop in the US, having previously run it in the Netherlands and Australia. It will be based on the 2nd edition of my book &ldquo;Forecasting: Principles and Practice&rdquo; with George Athanasopoulos. All participants will get a print version of the book.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/tdS-NK
