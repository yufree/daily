description: This is all super-simple; still, it might be useful. In class today a
  student asked for some intuition as to why, when you&#8217;re regressing y on x,
  measurement error on x biases the coefficient estimate but measurement error on
  y &#8230; <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/04/14/simulation-to-understand-measurement-error-in-regression/">Continue
