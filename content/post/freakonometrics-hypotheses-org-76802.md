description: After Florent last week, this Wednesday, Ana (Patrón Piñerez) will give
  a talk to conclude her internship in Montréal (supervised with Agathe), on Bayesian
  Improved Surname Geocoding to predict &#8220;Race&#8221; in the U.S. This study
  focuses on predicting race within the United States, a topic of significant sensitivity
  due to legal prohibitions against discrimination based on &#8216;race, color, or
  previous condition of servitude&#8217; (Civil Rights Act of 1866, 1964). At the
