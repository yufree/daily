description: Functional autoregressive models are popular for functional time series
  analysis, but the standard formulation fails to address seasonal behaviour in functional
  time series data. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce seasonal functional
  autoregressive time series models. For the model of order one, we derive sufficient
  stationarity conditions and limiting behaviour, and provide estimation and prediction
  methods. Moreover, we consider a portmanteau test for testing the adequacy of this
  model, and we derive its asymptotic ...
