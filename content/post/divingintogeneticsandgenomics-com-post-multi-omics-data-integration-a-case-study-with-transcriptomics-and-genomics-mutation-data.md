  <p>Multi-omics data analysis is a cutting-edge approach in biology that involves
  studying and integrating information from multiple biological “omics” sources. These
  omics sources include genomics (genes and their variations), transcriptomics (gene
  expression and RNA data), proteomics (proteins and their interactions), metabolomics
  (small molecules and metabolites), epigenomics (epigenetic modifications), and more.
  By analyzing data from various omics levels together, we can gain a more ...
