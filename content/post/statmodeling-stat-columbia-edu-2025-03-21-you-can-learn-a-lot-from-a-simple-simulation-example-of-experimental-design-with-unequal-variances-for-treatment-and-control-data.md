description: We were talking about blocking in experiments in class today, and a student
  asked, &#8220;When should we have unequal numbers of units in the treatment and
  control groups?&#8221; I replied that the simplest example is when the treatment
  is expensive. &#8230; <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/03/21/you-can-learn-a-lot-from-a-simple-simulation-example-of-experimental-design-with-unequal-variances-for-treatment-and-control-data/">Continue
