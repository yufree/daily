description: 'Deconstructing a time index into time granularities can assist in exploration
  and automated analysis of large temporal data sets. This paper describes classes
  of time deconstructions using linear and cyclic time granularities. Linear granularities
  respect the linear progression of time such as hours, days, weeks and months. Cyclic
  granularities can be circular such as hour-of-the-day, quasi-circular such as day-of-the-month,
  and aperiodic such as public holidays. The hierarchical structure of granularities
  creates a nested ordering: hour-of-the-day and second-of-the-minute are ...'
