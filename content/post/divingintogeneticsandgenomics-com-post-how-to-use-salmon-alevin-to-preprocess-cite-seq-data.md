  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>A state-of-the-art method called CITE-seq (Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing) allows surface protein levels and RNA expression to be measured simultaneously in individual cells. CITE-seq uses traditional single-cell RNA-sequencing to read out both transcriptome and proteomic information from <strong>the same cell</strong> after labeling it with oligo-conjugated antibodies. This gets over the ...
