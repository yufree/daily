description: In our previous post, we discussed &#8220;group fairness&#8220;. I might
  have gone a bit fast, and I decided to add some material about sensistive attributes,
  and proxies. Sensitive attributes ? Almost everywhere, we can find a list of variables
  that are considered, by law, as sensitive, since they will lead to discrimination.
  As mentioned earlier, sensitive variable might change with time, and accross regions&#8230;
  Another issue with black boxes is that it might be hard to assess if they are related
  to sensitive attribute. &#8230; <a href="https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/71560"
