title: Is the median far away from the mean (for variables with finite variance)?

description: A few years ago, Ryan J. Tibshirani published &#8220;Fast computation
  of the median by successive binning&#8221; with a nice lemma, The Mean Is Within
  One Standard Deviation of Any Median And a rather nice and simple proof is given.
  More formally, If is a random variable with mean , variance , and median , then
  . Writethus, from Jensen’s inequality,and because the median minimizes the function
  ,and because, we can writeand if we use the concave version of Jensen’s inequality,i.e.,
  Nice proof, isn&#8217;t it. &#8230; <a href="https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/82729"
