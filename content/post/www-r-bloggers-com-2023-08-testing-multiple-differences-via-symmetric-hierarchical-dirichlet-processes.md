  <p>Testing differences: from ANOVA to BNP<br />
  Detecting and quantifying differences between groups is a problem of crucial significance across various fields, often addressed by practitioners using standard analysis of variance (ANOVA). However, ANOVA is subject to several well-known limitations. It primarily detects differences only in group means, assumes homogeneity within ...</p></div>
