description: Our recent paper, Optimal Transport on Categorical Data for Counterfactuals
  using Compositional Data and Dirichlet Transport, with Agathe and Ewen is now online
  Recently, optimal transport-based approaches have gained attention for deriving
  counterfactuals, e.g., to quantify algorithmic discrimination. However, in the general
  multivariate setting, these methods are often opaque and difficult to interpret.
  To address this, alternative methodologies have been proposed, using causal graphs
  combined with iterative quantile regressions (Plečko and Meinshausen (2020)) or
  sequential transport ...
