description: In June 2025 we discussed 2 flavors of calibration, including &#8220;the
  logit shift&#8221;. In August 2025 we took 2nd helpings of the logit shift, focusing
  on multinomial outcomes. In December 2025 we took 3rd helpings, focusing on multivariate
  outcomes. Maybe folks &#8230; <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2026/01/06/survey-statistics-4th-helpings-of-the-logit-shift/">Continue
