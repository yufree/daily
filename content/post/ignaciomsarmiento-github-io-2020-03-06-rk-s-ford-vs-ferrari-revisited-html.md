  Koenker</a> reminded me about my post comparing <a href="https://ignaciomsarmiento.github.io/2017/01/20/Quantile-and-OLS-Regression-with-Rmosek.html"><em>quantreg</em>

  the traditional Barrondale and Roberts. However, <a href="http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~roger/">Roger</a>
  was curious about how it would compare to the interior point algorithms implemented
