description: Our paper, A Sequentially Fair Mechanism for Multiple Sensitive Attributes,
  with François Hu and Philipp Ratz, is now available on Arxiv, In the standard use
  case of Algorithmic Fairness, the goal is to eliminate the relationship between
  a sensitive variable and a corresponding score. Throughout recent years, the scientific
  community has developed a host of definitions and tools to solve this task, which
  work well in many practical applications. However, the applicability and effectivity
