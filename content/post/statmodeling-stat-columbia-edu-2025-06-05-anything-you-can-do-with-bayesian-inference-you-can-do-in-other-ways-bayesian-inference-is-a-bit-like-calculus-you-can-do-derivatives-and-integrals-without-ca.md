title: 'Anything you can do with Bayesian inference you can do in other ways. Bayesian
  inference is a bit like calculus: You can do derivatives and integrals without calculus
  (indeed, mathematicians in pre-Newtonian times were able to compute limits, with
  care), but calculus makes it a lot easier. Similarly, I find that Bayesian inference
  makes it a lot easier to combine information.'
