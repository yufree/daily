description: Our paper, &#8220;Functional Analysis of Loss-development Patterns in
  P&#38;C Insurance&#8221; written with Qiheng (Steve) Guo and Mike Ludkovski, is
  now available on ArXiv. We analyze loss development in NAIC Schedule P loss triangles
  using functional data analysis methods. Adopting the functional viewpoint, our dataset
  comprises 3300+ curves of incremental loss ratios (ILR) of workers&#8217; compensation
  lines over 24 accident years. Relying on functional data depth, we first study similarities
  and differences in development patterns based on company-specific covariates, as
  well as identify  ...
