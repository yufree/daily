description: For the fourth course, we will discuss Wasserstein distance and Optimal
  Transport. Last week, we mentioned distances, dissimilarity and divergences. But
  before talking about Wasserstein, we should mention Cramer distance. Cramer and
  Wasserstein distances The definition of Cramér distance, for , is while Wasserstein
  will be (also for ) If we consider cumulative distribution functions, for the first
  one (Cramer), we consider some sort of &#8220;vertical&#8221; distance, while for
  the second one (Wasserstein), we consider some &#8220;horizontal&#8221; one, Obviously,
