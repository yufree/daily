   <p>After over a year of silence, <a href="https://www.ensmallen.org/developers.html">Ensmallen Development Team</a> has released a new update! In this release, the team has added a new optimizer, Active CMAES, and fixed a few bugs. We also performed maintenance on the R side by increasing the R version required to R 4.0 to ensure a compiler with C++11 is available. We’ve also removed the explicit C++11 requirement from the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> and <code>Makevars{.win}</code> files.</p>
  <p>To dive deeper into any of the changes, please see the news entry for the package update ...
