   <p>Happy to share that a new package <a
  href="https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.int64.html">RcppInt64</a>
  arrived on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> earlier today
  after a brief one-day inspection round. <a
  href="https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.int64.html">RcppInt64</a>
  collects some of the previous conversions between 64-bit integer values
  in R and C++, and regroups them in a single package.</p>
  <p>A single header is provided. It actually offers two interfaces: both
  a more standard <code>as&lt;&gt;()</code> converter from R values along
  with its companions ...
