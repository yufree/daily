  Transport with Applications in Image Classification&#8221; is now online, with more
  discussion about conterfactuals Ensuring trust and accountability in Artificial
  Intelligence systems demands explainability of its outcomes. Despite significant
  progress in Explainable AI, human biases still taint a substantial portion of its
