  twice at IJCAI 2025. Early this week, it was the Doctoral Consortium, and yesterday,
  our joint paper on &#8220;Optimal Transport on Categorical Data for Counterfactuals
  using Compositional Data and Dirichlet Transport&#8221; Recently, optimal transport-based
  approaches have gained attention for deriving counterfactuals, e.g., to quantify
  algorithmic discrimination. However, in the general multivariate setting, these
  methods are often opaque and difficult to interpret. To address this, alternative
