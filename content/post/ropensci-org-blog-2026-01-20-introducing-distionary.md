  &lt;p&gt;After passing through rOpenSci peer review, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.ropensci.org/distionary/&#34;&gt;distionary&lt;/a&gt; package is now newly available on CRAN.
  It allows you to make probability distributions quickly – either from a few inputs or from its built-in library – and then probe them in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These distributions form the building blocks that piece together advanced statistical models with the wider &lt;a href=&#34;https://probaverse.com&#34;&gt;probaverse&lt;/a&gt; ecosystem, which is built to release modelers from low-level coding so ...
