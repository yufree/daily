   <p>We’re pleased to bring you the latest release of the <code>quarto-webr</code> extension, v0.4.0. This release brings an entirely new internal backend that improves the reliability and visual cues for non-interactive code cells. Additionally, the extension now supports a custom JSON format for code cell data and options. This has allowed for the introduction of more advanced code cell options, such as <code>autorun</code> that automatically runs code on document open. These options can be set in the code cell using standard hashpipe Quarto option style.</p>
