  <p>A good sports betting system is not a “pick-winners” machine. It’s an uncertainty engine: it turns data into probabilities, probabilities into expected value, and expected value into position sizes that survive variance. If you can do those three steps consistently, you can build a robust process— even if individual ...</p>
