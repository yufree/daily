  <p>I presented an extended abstract at the 57th Universities Transport Studies Group (UTSG) Annual Conference, held at University College Dublin on 25th June 2025.
  The abstract is titled &ldquo;Integrating diverse data sources to support future-proof transport modelling&rdquo; and discusses the limitations of traditional transport models that rely on limited input datasets, leading to biases and blind-spots in model outputs.
  The presentation highlights a case study of the Network Planning Tool for Scotland (NPT), which integrates multiple datasets to support more evidence-based and data-driven ...
