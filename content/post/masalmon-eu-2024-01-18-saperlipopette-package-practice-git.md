  <p>I got more confident with Git since reading <a href="https://masalmon.eu/2023/11/01/reading-notes-git-in-practice/">Git in practice</a>. This has resulted in a more enjoyable Git practice! I&rsquo;m also more keen to sharing Git &ldquo;tips&rdquo; with others, but felt it was challenging to quickly come up with examples to demo some Git workflows.
