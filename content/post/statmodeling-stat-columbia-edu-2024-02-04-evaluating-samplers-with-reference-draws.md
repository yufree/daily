description: I started thinking a bit more about what we&#8217;re doing when we use
  something like posteriordb (from Stan) or Inference Gym (from TensorFlow Probability)
  to evaluate a sampler. posteriordb gives you Stan programs and 10,000 reference
  draws from their posterior. &#8230; <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/02/04/evaluating-samplers-with-reference-draws/">Continue
