description: 'A few months ago, I was invited to give a lecture at the workshop “decentralized
  insurance and risk sharing” organized the day before the Insurance: Mathematics

  time (and a sabbatical) to write down some parts of my lectures that were not published.
  A short article is now available, entitled &#8220;Perceived Fairness in Networks&#8221;
  (this can be related to the recent papier Linear Risk Sharing on Networks we uploaded
