description: This Friday, I will be in Laval University, in Québec, to give a talk
  at the Statlab/INCASS-Québec/CIMMUL day. In this talk, we present two complementary
  approaches to addressing fairness in algorithmic decision-making, regarding individual
  and group fairness. First, we use Wasserstein barycenters to obtain (strong Demographic
  Parity) with one or multiple sensitive features. Our method provides a closed-form
  solution for the optimal, sequentially fair predictor, enabling possible interpretation
  of correlations between sensitive attributes. Then, we introduce a novel method
  that links two ...
