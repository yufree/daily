description: Our new paper, with François Hu and Philipp Ratz, Addressing Fairness
  and Explainability in Image Classification Using Optimal Transport, is now available
  on ArXiv. Algorithmic Fairness and the explainability of potentially unfair outcomes
  are crucial for establishing trust and accountability of Artificial Intelligence
  systems in domains such as healthcare and policing. Though significant advances
  have been made in each of the fields separately, achieving explainability in fairness
  applications remains challenging, particularly so in domains where deep neural networks
  are used. At the same ...
