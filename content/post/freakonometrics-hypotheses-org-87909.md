description: 'Almost two years ago, “Insurance, Biases, Discrimination and Fairness”
  was published.  A quick note: the book was initially based on a (long) report published
  by the Institut Louis Bachelier, in both French and English (with links on my blog)
  ☐ French : https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/63834 ☐ English : https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/63866
  Since these links (on the ILB website) are now dead (and I can’t find the reports
  on the website anymore &#8211; 404 error), I re-uploaded both versions — people
  often ask me for them. ☑︎ Report (EN): &#8230; <a href="https://freakonometrics.hy
