  <p>There are tons of well-known global indicators. We’ve all heard of gross
  domestic product, life expectancy, rate of literacy, etc. But, ever
  since I discovered <a href="https://pinballmap.com/">pinballmap.com</a>, possibly
  the world’s most comprehensive database of public pinball locations,
  I’ve been thinking about a potential new global indicator: Public
  Pinball Machines per Capita. Thanks to Pinball Map’s <a href="https://pinballmap.com/api/v1/docs/1.0.html">well-documented
  public API</a>, this indicator
