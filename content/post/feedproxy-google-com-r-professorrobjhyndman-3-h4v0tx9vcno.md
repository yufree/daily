description: Outliers due to technical errors in water-quality data from in situ sensors
  can reduce data quality and have a direct impact on inference drawn from subsequent
  data analysis. However, outlier detection through manual monitoring is unfeasible
  given the volume and velocity of data the sensors produce. Here, we proposed an
  automated framework that provides early detection of outliers in water-quality data
  from in situ sensors caused by technical issues.The framework was used first to
  identify the data features that differentiate outlying instances from typical behaviours.<img
