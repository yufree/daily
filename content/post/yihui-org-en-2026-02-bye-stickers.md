  <p>As one small sign of moving towards minimalism, I decided not to make a hex sticker for the <strong>litedown</strong> package when I started writing it in 2024. To be precise, I didn&rsquo;t want to make a sticker image (PNG or SVG). I did make sticker-like ASCII art for the package, which you can find in <a href="https://github.com/yihui/litedown">the README file</a>. It may look ugly (especially on Windows), but it&rsquo;s tiny: only 55 bytes in total. I didn&rsquo;t need to use any image editing software, and it only took me a few minutes to make.</p>
