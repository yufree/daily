  <p>The Rcpp Core Team is once again thrilled to announce a new release
  1.0.12 of the <a href="https://www.rcpp.org">Rcpp</a> package. It
  arrived on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> early today,
  and has since been uploaded to <a
  href="https://www.debian.org">Debian</a> as well. Windows and macOS
  builds should appear at CRAN in the next few days, as will builds in
  different Linux distribution–and of course at <a
