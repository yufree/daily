description: This paper introduces lookout, a new approach to detect outliers using
  leave-one-out kernel density estimates and extreme value theory. Outlier detection
  methods that use kernel density estimates generally employ a user defined parameter
  to determine the bandwidth. Lookout uses persistent homology to construct a bandwidth
  suitable for outlier detection without any user input. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of lookout on an extensive data repository by comparing its performance with other
  outlier detection methods based on extreme value ...
