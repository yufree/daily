description: 'With Cassandra Mussard, intern last summer, and Stéphane Mussard, we
  uploaded a paper entitled KNN and K-means in Gini Prametric Spaces on ArXiv. This
  paper introduces innovative enhancements to the K-means and K-nearest neighbors
  (KNN) algorithms based on the concept of Gini prametric spaces. Unlike traditional
  distance metrics, Gini-based measures incorporate both value-based and rank-based
  information, improving robustness to noise and outliers. The main contributions
  of this work include: proposing a Gini-based measure that captures both rank information
  and value distances; presenting a ...'
