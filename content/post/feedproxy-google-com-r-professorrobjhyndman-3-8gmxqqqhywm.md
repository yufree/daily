title: Anomaly detection in streaming nonstationary temporal data

description: This article proposes a framework that provides early detection of anomalous
  series within a large collection of non-stationary streaming time series data. We
  define an anomaly as an observation that is very unlikely given the recent distribution
  of a given system. The proposed framework first forecasts a boundary for the system&rsquo;s
  typical behavior using extreme value theory. Then a sliding window is used to test
  for anomalous series within a newly arrived collection of series.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/8gmXqqqhYwM"
