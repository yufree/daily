   <p>It’s been nearly nine years since the <a href="../hyndsight/forecast8/">last major release of the forecast package</a>, as we have been focusing on developing <a href="https://fable.tidyverts.org/"><code>fable</code></a> and <a href="https://tidyverts.org">related packages</a> as a tidyverse-based alternative for time series forecasting in R.</p>
  <p>However, version 9.0 of the <code>forecast</code> package has now been released on CRAN. Thanks to Maximilian Muecke for helping with this release, and for modernising some of the old code.</p>
  <p>Here are the main new features and changes.</p>
