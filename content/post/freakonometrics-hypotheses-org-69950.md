  Here, we will see, how based on some data that were initially collected, and a model
  (a pricing model), it is possible to remove the discrimination in our pricing model.
  Biases everywhere As mentioned previously, insurance princing is based on the use
  of different datasets, at least one from &#8220;claims&#8221; and one from &#8220;underwriting&#8221;.
  And obviously, there might be biases in &#8230; <a href="https://freakonometrics.
