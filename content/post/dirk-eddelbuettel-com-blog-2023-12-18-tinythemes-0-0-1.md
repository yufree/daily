   <p>Delighted to announce a new package that arrived on <a
  href="https://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> today: <a
  href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/tinythemes">tinythemes</a>. It
  repackages the <code>theme_ipsum_rc()</code> function by <a
  href="https://rud.is/">Bob Rudis</a> from his <a
  href="https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes"><code>hrbrthemes</code></a>
  package in a zero (added) dependency way. A simple example is (also
  available as a demo inside the packages in the next update) contrasts
  the default style (on left) with the one added by this package (on the
  right):</p>
