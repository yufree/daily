description: We examine the relationships between electoral socio-demographic characteristics
  and two-party preference in the six Australian federal elections held between 2001
  to 2016. Socio-demographic information is derived from the Australian Census, which
  occurs every five years. Since a Census is not directly available for each election,
  spatio-temporal imputation is employed to estimate Census data for the electorates
  at the time of each election. This accounts for both spatial and temporal changes
  in electoral characteristics between Censuses.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHy
