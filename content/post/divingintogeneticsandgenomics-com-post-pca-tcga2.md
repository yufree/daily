  <p>In my <a href="https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/pca-tcga/">last blog post</a>, I showed you how to download TCGA RNAseq count data and
  do PCA and make a heatmap. It is interesting to see some of the LUSC samples mix with the LUAD samples and vice versa.</p>
  <p>In this post, we will continue to use PCA to do more Exploratory data analysis (EDA).</p>
  <p>Let’s further investigate those ...
