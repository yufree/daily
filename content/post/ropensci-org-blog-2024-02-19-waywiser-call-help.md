  The package waywiser maintained by Mike Mahoney provides ergonomic methods for assessing spatial models. Assessing predictive models of spatial data can be challenging, both because these models are typically built for extrapolating outside the original region represented by training data and due to potential spatially structured errors, with &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; of higher than expected error clustered geographically due to spatial structure in the underlying data. The waywiser package tries to make it easier, providing methods for assessing models fit to spatial data, including ...
