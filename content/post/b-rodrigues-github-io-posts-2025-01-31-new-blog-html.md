  <p>Happy new year! The blog has a new look! Well it’s not that different on the surface. But under the hood, it is quite different indeed!</p>
  <p>My previous setup was: GitHub to host the code, on each push the build process would get started on Netlify and then it would be hosted there. The engine was Hugo.</p>
  <p>This blog now still uses GitHub to host the code, but now also uses GitHub ...
