  <p>In the world of deep learning, generating sequence data is a fundamental task.
  Typically, this involves training a network, often an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
  or a convnet (Convolutional Neural Network), to <strong>predict the next token or
  a sequence of tokens in a given sequence, using the preceding tokens as input</strong>.
  For example, when provided with the input “the cat is on the ma,” the network’s
  objective is to predict the next character, such as ‘t.’ When working with ...
