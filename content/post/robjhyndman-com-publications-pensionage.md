description: We forecast the old-age dependency ratio for Australia under various
  pension age proposals, and estimate a pension age scheme that will provide a stable
  old-age dependency ratio at a specified level. Our approach involves a stochastic
  population forecasting method based on coherent functional data models for mortality,
  fertility and net migration, which we use to simulate the future age-structure of
  the population. Our results suggest that the Australian pension age should be increased
  to 68 by 2030, 69 by 2036, and 70 by 2050, in order to maintain the old-age dependency
  ratio at 23%, just ...
