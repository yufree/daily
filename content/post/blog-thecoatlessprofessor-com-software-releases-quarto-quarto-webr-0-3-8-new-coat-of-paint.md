   <p>In <code>quarto-webr</code> version 0.3.8, we have made a number of changes to the extension to improve the user experience and make it easier to use. We’ve added a new <code>autoload-packages</code> document meta option key that will automatically load packages specified in the <code>packages</code> key. We’ve also added new output classes to differentiate between STDOUT and STDERR text as well as documented the extension’s theming capabilities. Lastly, we’ve fixed a bug related to the placement of the “WebR Status” indicator when in the <code>revealjs</code> presentation format.</p>
