description: This summer, Agathe will present our recent paper Optimal Transport on
  Categorical Data for Counterfactuals using Compositional Data and Dirichlet Transport
  at the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI. Recently,
  optimal transport-based approaches have gained attention for deriving counterfactuals,
  e.g., to quantify algorithmic discrimination. However, in the general multivariate
  setting, these methods are often opaque and difficult to interpret. To address this,
  alternative methodologies have been proposed, using causal graphs combined with
  iterative quantile ...
