  pip3 install tinytopics tinytopics is a minimalist solution designed to scale up topic modeling tasks on CPUs and GPUs using PyTorch.
  Motivation Fitting topic models at scale using classical algorithms on CPUs can be slow. Carbonetto et al. (2022) demonstrated the equivalence between Poisson non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and multinomial topic model ...
