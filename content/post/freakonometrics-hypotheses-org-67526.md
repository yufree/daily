description: Our paper, Generalized Oversampling for Learning from Imbalanced datasets
  and Associated Theory, is now online on ArXiv. In supervised learning, it is quite
  frequent to be confronted with real imbalanced datasets. This situation leads to
  a learning difficulty for standard algorithms. Research and solutions in imbalanced
  learning have mainly focused on classification tasks. Despite its importance, very
  few solutions exist for imbalanced regression. In this paper, we propose a data
  augmentation procedure, the GOLIATH algorithm, based on kernel density estimates
  which can be used &#8230; <a ...
