   <p>An update to the <a
  href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/gunsales">gunsales package</a> is
  now on <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org">CRAN</a>. As in the last
  update nine years ago (!!), changes are mostly internal. An upcoming
  <code>dplyr</code> change requires a switch from the old and soon
  to-be-removed ‘underscored’ verb form; that was kindly addressed in an
  incoming pull request. We also updated the CI scripts a few times during
  this period as needed, and switched to using Authors@R, and refreshed
  and updated a number of URL references.</p>
