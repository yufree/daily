description: We just arrived in Kyoto (京都), Japan, from Montréal, Canada. Everything
  seems very different. I still have in mind the time I spent in Hong Kong (more than
  a year), but that was 25 years ago&#8230; Just to compare, I used wikipedia&#8217;s
  page of Kyoto vs. Montréal. Quite naturaly, I used the pages in French, but that
  was not stupid because the pages in English are more compex to read (with temperatures
  in °C and °F, humidity in mm and inches, etc). urlM="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montr%C3%A9al"
