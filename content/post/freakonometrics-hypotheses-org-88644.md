  distribution-free uncertainty quantification for machine learning models, yet its
  interplay with fairness in downstream decision-making remains underexplored. Moving
  beyond CP as a standalone operation (procedural fairness), we analyze the holistic
  decision-making pipeline to evaluate substantive fairness-the equity of downstream
