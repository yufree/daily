   <p>I’m excited to introduce a new web-based language agnostic tool that simplifies the process of converting web-based tabular data into code that could be used to importing the data into data science languages like R, Python, and Julia. This tool is especially useful for data scientists and analysts who frequently work with data from the web; but often find it cumbersome to extract and convert one-off data into a format that can be easily imported into their data analysis environment.</p>
