description: Global Forecasting Models (GFM) that are trained across a set of multiple
  time series have shown superior results in many forecasting competitions and real-world
  applications compared with univariate forecasting approaches. One aspect of the
  popularity of statistical forecasting models such as ETS and ARIMA is their relative
  simplicity and interpretability (in terms of relevant lags, trend, seasonality,
  and others), while GFMs typically lack interpretability, especially towards particular
