description: '<p>I’ve been reading two somewhat depressing documents today.</p><p>The
  American Statistical Association has put out a<a href="http://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/POL-Statistics-as-a-Scientific-Discipline.pdf">
  position pape</a>r titled “Overview of Statistics as a Scientific Discipline and
  Practical Implications for the Evaluation of Faculty Excellence“. It says, in the
  executive summary</p><blockquote><p>Statistics is at the same time a dynamic, stand-alone
  science with its own core research agenda and an inherently collaborative discipline,
  developing in response to scientific needs. In this sense, statistics fundamentally
  differs from many other domain-specific disciplines in science. This difference
  poses unique challenges for defining the standards by which faculty excellence is
  evaluated across the teaching, research, and service components.</p><p>This document
  strives to provide a conceptual framework and practical guidelines to facilitate
  such evaluations. To that end, the intended audience includes all participants in
  the evaluation process—provosts and deans with faculty members in statistics positions;
  chairs and heads of statistics, biostatistics, and non-statistics departments; and
  the promotion and tenure evaluation committees in academic institutions.Furthermore,
  this document seeks to assist statistical scientists in the negotiation of faculty
  positions and the articulation of their collaborative role with the subject-matter
  sciences.<br/></p></blockquote><p>The position paper references a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4653084/">paper</a>
  from a few years ago called “Evaluating Academic Scientists Collaborating in Team-Based
  Research: A Proposed Framework”. The latter is by people in biostatistics/epi (the
  former, rather notably, has no names from biostatistics departments).  They both
  deal with the question of how to get people promoted when they do a lot of collaborative
  research rather than sitting in an office proving theorems.<br/></p><p>Both papers
  are good as far as they go. But, as <a href="https://twitter.com/askdrstats/status/954773643564847104">Di
  Cook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/954800417166082048">others</a>
  pointed out on Twitter, one of the places they don’t go is where most modern statistics
  lives. There is no mention of “computing”, “programming”, or “software”,  “open”
  or “reproducible”. Twenty years ago, this lack would have been unfortunate but unremarkable.
  Today, it’s bizarre. </p><p>So, what should the position paper say about computing?
  Here’s a start:</p><ol><li>Statistical software development and publishing is also
  “a legitimate and essential scholarly activity” for the discipline.<br/></li><li>Data
  analysis is part of statistics, so that research on the theory, practice, and teaching
  of data analysis is statistics research</li><li>Software may be important either
  because it contributes to the discipline of statistical computing, or because it
  improves the quality of research in other areas of science (or both). </li><li>Software
  often develops over time: peer review before initial publication may be neither
  necessary nor sufficient</li><li>Some statistical computing is crap; knowledgeable
  evaluation is necessary.</li><li>Recognising that expertise may be hard to find,
  the ASA (or other relevant bodies) should assist departments in finding reviewers
  to evaluate statistical computing and data science research</li><li>Department chairs
  should make sure expectations and criteria are clear.</li></ol><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><i>[Two
  clarifications: </i></p><p><i>for 6. A set of explicit criteria would be much better,
  but i think it’s easier to get agreement on particular cases than to get agreement
  on a set of criteria &ndash; a workshop in 2001 didn’t manage.</i></p><p><i>for
  7: what the expectations and criteria are, not what they should be&ndash; if your
  department is not going to promote someone without an Annals paper, you need to
  know that]</i></p>'
