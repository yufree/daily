description: 'Our paper &#8220;Sequential Conditional Transport on Probabilistic Graphs

  to derive counterfactuals: adaptations based on a causal graph, as suggested in
  Plečko and Meinshausen (2020) and optimal transport, as in De Lara et al. (2024).
  We extend &#8220;Knothe&#8217;s rearrangement&#8221; Bonnotte (2013) and &#8220;triangular
