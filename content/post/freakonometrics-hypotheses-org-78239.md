description: This Thursday, Julien Trufin will be giving a talk at the CANSSI SSC
  Seminar, live from Montréal Machine learning techniques provide actuaries with predictors
  exhibiting high correlation with claim frequencies and severities. However, these
  predictors generally fail to achieve financial equilibrium and thus do not qualify
  as pure premiums. Autocalibration effectively addresses this issue since it ensures
  that every group of policyholders paying the same premium is on average self-financing.
  This talk proposes to look at recent results concerning autocalibration. In particular,
