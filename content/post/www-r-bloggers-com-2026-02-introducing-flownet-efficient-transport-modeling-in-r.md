  <p>I am excited to introduce a new R package called flownet providing high-performance tools for transport modeling—network processing, route enumeration, and traffic assignment in R. As of now, the package implements the Path-Sized Logit (PSL) model (Ben-Akiva and Bierlaire, 1999)—a powerful and well-established method for stochastic traffic assignment accounting ...</p></div>
