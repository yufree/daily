description: The quick way of saying this is that using a mathematical model informed
  by background information to set a prior distribution for logistic regression is
  no more &#8220;subjective&#8221; than deciding to run a logistic regression in the
  first place. Here&#8217;s &#8230; <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/03/27/bayesian-inference-with-informative-priors-is-not-inherently-subjective/">Continue
