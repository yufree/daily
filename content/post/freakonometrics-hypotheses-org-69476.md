  Paris

description: This Friday, I will give a talk in Paris, on using optimal transport
  to mitigate unfair predictions, at the ARC Seminar. The insurance industry is heavily
  reliant on predictions of risks based on characteristics of potential customers.
  Although the use of said models is common, researchers have long pointed out that
  such practices perpetuate discrimination based on sensitive features such as gender
  or race. Given that such discrimination can often be attributed to historical data
  biases, an elimination or at least mitigation is desirable. &#8230; <a href="https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org
