  Last spring, Ed Zitron published a fascinating text, and yes, a bit long, The Era
  Of The Business Idiot, which I only discovered at the start of the holidays (sorry).
  He does not just say that some organizations are badly managed, he describes a type
  of social selection. He explains that you climb the hierarchy because you know how
  to produce signs of competence, not because you know how to understand a problem
  and solve it. &#8230; <a href="https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/87215" ...
