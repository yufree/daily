  <p>There are many website analytics applications available today. Aside from the dominant but privacy-concerning Google Analytics, I have been using <a href="https://umami.is/">Umami</a> for some time as my personal choice.</p>
  <p>After building my company website with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>, I wanted to integrate Umami into it.
