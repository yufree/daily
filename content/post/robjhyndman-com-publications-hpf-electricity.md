description: Decisions regarding the supply of electricity across a power grid must
  take into consideration the inherent uncertainty in demand. Optimal decision-making
  requires probabilistic forecasts for demand in a hierarchy with various levels of
  aggregation, such as substations, cities and regions. The forecasts should be coherent
  in the sense that the forecast of the aggregated series should equal the sum of
  the forecasts of the corresponding disaggregated series. Coherency is essential,
  since the allocation of electricity at one level of the hierarchy relies on the
  appropriate amount being provided ...
