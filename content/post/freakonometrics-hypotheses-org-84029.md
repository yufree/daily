description: (via Linkedin) This illustration highlights the diversity of mathematics
  and its links to our environment. The childlike aesthetic of the image, similar
  to a seek-and-find game, is a deliberate choice to attract the attention of a wide
  audience. Mathematics is intrinsically present in nature, as evidenced by the geometric
  shapes of shells, sunflowers, ferns, and the hexagons of honeycombs. Conversely,
  nature is a source of mathematical inspiration and has led to the development of
  models such as predator-prey dynamics, river flow, and resource management. &#8230;
