description: Our paper, Data Augmentation with Variational Autoencoder for Imbalanced
  Dataset, with Samuel Stocksieker and Denys Pommeret is now online on ArXiv. Learning
  from an imbalanced distribution presents a major challenge in predictive modeling,
  as it generally leads to a reduction in the performance of standard algorithms.
  Various approaches exist to address this issue, but many of them concern classification
  problems, with a limited focus on regression. In this paper, we introduce a novel
