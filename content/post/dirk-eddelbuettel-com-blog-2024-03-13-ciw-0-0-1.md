   <p>Happy to share that <a
  href="https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/ciw.html">ciw</a> is now on <a
  href="https://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a>! I had tooted a little bit
  about it, <em>e.g.</em>, <a
  href="https://mastodon.social/@eddelbuettel/112016349028986595">here</a>.
  What it provides is a single (efficient) function
  <code>incoming()</code> which summarises the state of the incoming
  directories at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a>. I happen
  to like having these things at my (shell) fingertips, so it goes along
  with (still draft) <a
