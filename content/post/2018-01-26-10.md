  For the last few years, I have been involved with running a 3-day short course on &ldquo;Data Science for Managers&rdquo;. We have run it twice each year since 2015, and it continues to prove very popular. We have some awesome presenters including Monash University professors Di Cook, Geoff Webb, and Kim Marriott, as well as several very experienced data scientists working in industry.
  The next course will be held on 8-10 May 2018.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/
