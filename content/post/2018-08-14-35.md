description: Occasionally R might not be the tool you want to use (hard to believe,
  but apparently that happens). Then you may need to export some data from R via a
  csv file. When the data is stored as a ts object, the time index can easily get
  lost. So I wrote a little function to make this easier, using the tsibble package
  to do almost all of the work in looking after the time index.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/YZR-ipjg2sw"
