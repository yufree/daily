description: After 12 years, we&#8217;ve finally figured out how to do NUTS-like local
  step-size adaptation for NUTS that preserves detailed balance. This is starting
  from Michael Betancourt&#8217;s revised multinomial NUTS, as used in Stan, with
  a biasing toward the last doubling. &#8230; <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/08/16/gist-now-with-local-step-size-adaptation-for-nuts/">Continue
