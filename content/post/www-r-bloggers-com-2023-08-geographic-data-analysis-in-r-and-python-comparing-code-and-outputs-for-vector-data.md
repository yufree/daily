  <p>Introduction<br />
  In this blog post, we talk about our experience teaching R and Python for geocomputation. The focus of the blog post is on geographic vector data, meaning points, lines, polygons (and their ‘multi’ variants) and the attributes associated with them. Geographic data analysis is a broad topic and in ...</p>
