  <p>Sometimes it feels a bit silly when a simple statistical model has a
  fancy-sounding name. But it also feels good to drop the following in
  casual conversation: “Ah, then I recommend a Plackett-Luce model, a
  straightforward generalization of the Bradley–Terry model, you know”,
  when a friend wonders how they could model their, say, pinball
  championship dataset. Incidentally, in this post we’re going to model
  the result of the IFPA 18 World Pinball Championship using a
  Plackett-Luce model, implemented in Stan as a generalization of the
  Bradley–Terry model, you know.</p>
